# Summary of scanner.workers.js

This file defines additional components for the component-based messaging system (kernel.js). It includes several specialized worker components and a main function to initialize and start the system.

## Worker Components

1. **Count**
   - Maintains a counter and direction of counting
   - Increments or decrements the counter when receiving an "adv" message
   - Reverses counting direction when receiving a "rev" message

2. **Monitor**
   - Toggles display elements on or off based on numeric input
   - Handles "reset" messages to turn elements off

3. **Decode**
   - Processes numeric input (0-9) and routes messages accordingly
   - Sends the input value to the matching output port
   - Always sends a "done" signal after processing

4. **Reverser**
   - Alternates between states "J" and "K"
   - Changes state and outputs a message when receiving input on the opposite port

5. **Divider**
   - Counts incoming messages and outputs a message every DIVIDERCOUNT inputs
   - Maintains an internal counter that resets after reaching the threshold

6. **Disable**
   - Outputs sequential numbers from 0 to 9 on corresponding ports

## Main Function

The file includes a `main()` function that:
1. Initializes the system from a string configuration
2. Installs all the worker components into the component registry
3. Starts execution with the "main" container
4. Logs the beginning and end of execution

This file extends the component library with specialized workers focused on counting, state management, and signal processing within the reactive message-passing architecture.
