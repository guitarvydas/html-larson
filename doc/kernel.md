The component-based message-passing system is generated from specifications in `0d.rt` and `stock.rt`

1. **Core Messaging Architecture**:
   - Components communicate via "mevents" (message events) that flow through ports
   - Each component has input and output queues for message handling
   - Components can be either "leaf" components (basic units) or "containers" (which contain other components)
   - [I sometimes use the words "Worker Parts" and "Choreographer Parts" to mean exactly the same as "Leaf Parts" and "Container Parts"].

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Components are written as _templates_, then instantiated at runtime using the `Eh` class.
   - At runtime, components (`Eh` class) have states (idle/active), names, one input queue, one output queue, and `mevent` handlers
   - Containers manage internal components and route messages between them
   - The system uses a registry to manage component templates and instantiate components

3. **Connection Types**:
   - Four connection types for message routing: "down", "across", "up", and "through"
   - These define the flow of messages between components and their containers
   - Dividing connections into 4 kinds makes it possible to nest and layer components and enables better structuring of message-based systems.

4. **Message Routing System**:
   - Messages are routed via "connectors" that link senders and receivers
   - Each connector specifies source/target components and ports
   - A sophisticated routing system determines where messages go

5. **Data Management**:
   - `Datum` class for data management with cloning and reclaiming support
   - Various utilities for string handling and symbol generation

6. **Component Lifecycle**:
   - Functions to create, step, and destroy components
   - State tracking for active/idle components
	 - active/idle state is not needed by "normal" components and is used only for implementing long-running calls to external code

7. **Initialization and Loading**:
   - Can load component definitions from files or strings
   - Functions for initializing the component palette and starting execution

8. **Error Handling**:
   - Basic error reporting for load-time and runtime errors

This is a part of a larger system for visual or flow-based programming, where components are connected in a diagram and messages flow between them according to the connections. The code handles the internal machinery of message routing, component instantiation, and execution flow.
